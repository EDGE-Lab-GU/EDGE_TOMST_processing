# Template

This template is designed to provide a structured framework for organizing and managing the EDGE-Lab projects.

How Templates Work on GitHub:

When you create a new repository based on a template, GitHub copies all the files and folders from the template repository into your new repository. This includes any README files, folder structures, and other project assets defined in this template.

Using This Template:

1.  Create Your Project: Create a new repository and select in \*\* Repository template `EDGE-Lab-GU/Template` from the display menu.

2.  Modify README: After creating your project, you can modify this README file with a brief description of your project, including the name of the project leader or team leader at the top. Add any additional information or customization to suit your project's needs.

3.  Customize Folder READMEs: Within each folder of your project, you'll find README files providing guidance on the contents and purpose of that folder. Feel free to modify these README files to provide specific instructions or details relevant to your project

4.  Start Working: Once you've set up your project using the template, you're ready to start working! Use the provided folder structure to organize your files, scripts, data, and other project assets.

5.  Invite Collaborators: You can also invited collaborators to your repository. Do not forget to set properly the permissions.

6.  By default, the `Inputs/Raw_data` folder is added to the .gitignore file. The purpose of this exclusion is to prevent large files, commonly found in raw data directories, from being stored in the GitHub repository. Storing large files on GitHub can increase repository size and cause issues with cloning and syncing.

    If you intend to change this behavior and include files from the `Inputs/Raw_data` folder in your GitHub repository, you'll need to modify the .gitignore file accordingly.
